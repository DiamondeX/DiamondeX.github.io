<p>Hello! Here you can find information about my projects as well as about me, my work and interests.</p>

<h3>
<a id="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My projects</h3>

<p>Currently I have only made one public project, <a href="http://DiamondeX.github.io/mechounter">Mechounter</a>. It's a UI component representing enumerable multidigit values that looks and behaves like a mechanical counter. It is written as a JavaScript plugin and currently available in jQuery flavor only.</p>

<a id="bio" class="anchor" href="#bio" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Brief bio</h3>

<p>My real name Ruslan Zhomir. I was born in Ufa, Russia, but now I live in Rehau, Germany. I started my career as an IT teacher. Soon I moved on to work as a consulting developer in the field of ERP solutions. This was not the job I dreamed of, and I started looking for an opportunity to go into game or web development. Such an opportunity appeared in the summer of 2012. Since then, I have been happily doing what I love to do.</p>

<h3>
<a id="interests" class="anchor" href="#interests" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My interests</h3>

<p>I am passionate about educational computer games. As a result, I am interested in game development, educational and web technologies. I would like to find like-minded people and create an innovative educational online game with AAA-project quality or at least participate in such a project to realize my ideas. I will be glad to any suggestion on the topic to my e-mail: <a href="mailto:ruslanjf@gmail.com">ruslanjf@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>Still, I believe in the future of mankind as laid out in the Holy Scriptures (most commonly known as the Bible). Therefore, it is my favorite book.
